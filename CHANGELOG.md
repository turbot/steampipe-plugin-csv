_What's new?_

- Added support to read gzipped CSV files. ([#41](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-csv/pull/41)) (Thanks to [@daeho-ro](https://github.com/daeho-ro) for the new feature!)
- Added `header` config argument, which allows you to set if the first row should be used a header row when determining each table's column names. By default, `header` is set to `auto`, so if the first row is a valid header row, i.e., no missing or duplicate values, its values will be used for column names; else, generic column names, e.g., "a", "b", will be used. For more information, please see [Column Names](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/csv/tables/{csv_filename}#column-names).

## v0.4.1 [2022-10-19]

_Bug fixes_

- Fixed the plugin to skip the non-standard Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start of some CSV files (for instance, UTF-8 encoded CSV files from Excel) which would make the first column of such CSV files not queryable.

## v0.4.0 [2022-09-28]

_Dependencies_

- Recompiled plugin with [steampipe-plugin-sdk v4.1.7](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v417-2022-09-08) which includes several caching and memory management improvements. ([#34](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-csv/pull/34))
- Recompiled plugin with Go version `1.19`. ([#34](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-csv/pull/34))

## v0.3.2 [2022-06-23]

_Bug fixes_

- Fixed an issue in the `{csv_filename}` tables where values would always be `null` for header columns with a period in their name. ([#25](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-csv/pull/25))

## v0.3.1 [2022-05-23]

_Bug fixes_

_Enhancements_

## v0.2.0 [2022-02-14]

_What's new?_

- File loading and matching through the `paths` argument has been updated to make the plugin easier to use:
  - The `paths` argument is no longer commented out by default for new plugin installations and now defaults to the current working directory
  - Recursive directory searching (`**`) is now supported
- Previously, when using wildcard matching (`*`), non-CSV files were automatically excluded to prevent parsing errors. These files are no longer automatically excluded to allow for a wider range of matches. If your current configuration uses wildcard matching, e.g., `paths = [ "/path/to/my/files/*" ]`, please update it to include the file extension, e.g., `paths = [ "/path/to/my/files/*.csv" ]`.
